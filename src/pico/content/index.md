<p class="notice">A powerful debut novel about a group of 30-somethings struggling for connection and belonging, <em>Migratory Animals</em> centers on a protagonist who finds herself torn between love and duty.</p>
<p>When Flannery, a young scientist, is forced to return to Austin from five years of research in Nigeria, she becomes pulled between her two homes. Having left behind her loving fiancé without knowing when she can return, Flan learns that her sister, Molly, has begun to show signs of the crippling genetic disease that slowly killed their mother.</p>
<p>As their close-knit circle of friends struggles with Molly’s diagnosis, Flannery must grapple with what her future will hold: an ambitious life of love and the pursuit of scientific discovery in West Africa, or the pull of a life surrounded by old friends, the comfort of an old flame, family obligations, and the home she’s always known. But she is not the only one wrestling with uncertainty. Since their college days, each of her friends has faced unexpected challenges that make them reevaluate the lives they’d always planned for themselves.</p>
<p>A mesmerizing debut from an exciting young writer, <em>Migratory Animals</em> is a moving, thought-provoking novel, told from shifting viewpoints, about the meaning of home and what we owe each other—and ourselves.</p>
